#Owncloud to share files and data with each other
There is a dockerized version on docker-hub, which is complete except for the LDAP libraries for php. So we take the Dockerfile from the 9.0 version and add some extra lines.
See Dockerfile for further details

```bash
docker build -f Dockerfile -t owncloud-ldap .
